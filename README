# DATA SET FOR *OPEN SCIENCE POLICY*

1. All the datas are serialized by pickle(Python 3.8).

2. For "*reports.pkl" and "*records_pkl" files, the data stored is normal python instance which is also self-explanatory.

3. In any names:
 prefix "bat" stands for the tool "BAT", 
 prefix "oss" stands for the tool "OssPolice",
 prefix "bcd" stands for the method "BCD",
 prefix "abcd" or not prefix stand for our tool.

4. The "*_grouper.pkl" files have the modularization results, which are stored as "Grouper" like classes.
The definition and usage of the classes can be found in the directory "/utility_scripts".
You can use script "from group_class import *" to import the needed classes before loading any "*_grouper.pkl".

5. All the "Grouper" instance can be corresponding to the binary file in the data set by name.
But by this time, the corresponding scripts are not offered.

6. The corresponding scripts as well as many other scripts like, scripts for extracting functions and features from binaries,
scripts for modularization, scripts for showing results graphically in IDA-pro just like the figures in the paper, etc., 
are not open now because it might include plenty information about the authors.
We prefer to make these codes avaliable upon acceptance.
