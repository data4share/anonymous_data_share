The two malwares in the "non-mirai" directory is another malware very similar to Mirai named "Gafgyt".
The NEGETIVE detection of "libmirai" on the "Gafgyt" is viewed as "True Positive" because it does not belongs to the Mirai family.

We designed this to show the ability the tool can tell Mirai from other malware.
But, this is not mentioned in the paper because it's a little hard to explain it with other results in a same table.
